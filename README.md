Overview
---
While driving, humans perceive and understand that the proper paths to follow are indicated by traffic annotations in the form of lines on the ground. As drivers, we have been trained to monitor and adhere to these this guiding lines, however as Engineers, we must also construct a perception pipeline for a robot to detect and maintain these in a similar fashion.

This project aims to detect lane lines in pre-selected images using Python and OpenCV.  OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images.
